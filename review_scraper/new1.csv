delvon green,"<span class=""review-full-text"" style=""display:none"">Ann Marie is the sales person everybody should encounter. She is an amazing soul with high energy. She help my sister get a car like a year and a half ago and turned around to help me get in a car. She‚Äôs very detailed, organized, patient, and helpful. She‚Äôs was there with me every step of the way. She didn‚Äôt  to leave until after I signed My paperwork. I thought  she left after she walked me to my new car. I was In the parking lot talking on the phone, she pulled up just to make sure that I was okay. She told me anybody that I help isn‚Äôt a customer they become family. May be small to some but that‚Äôs big for me. She‚Äôs invested in her career. It‚Äôs not about a sale or a pay check with her, she‚Äôs really there to make sure this is  what you really want to invest in. Even the guy that help me signed my paperwork was AMAZING! Im sorry but I forgot his name. He was super funny, explained every document to me in full detail. I‚Äôm like pinch me, I must be dreaming but I wasn‚Äôt. They were two awesome angles that was sent to brighten up my day! Concord Honda is the place to go!</span>",5.0,6 days ago

Vince Rossi,"<span class=""review-full-text"" style=""display:none"">Salesman was helpful. Didn't get me the deal I initially wanted to do but his alternative suggestion worked well. However the communication between him and the finance ans the team wasn't good. Trade equity check took twice as long to get then what was promised (was told 3 to 5 days, got it on the 11th day after the sale and I had to go to the dealer twice to make it happen since nobody answers the phones and they give you the transfer in circle game). Probably wouldn't shop here again but again the Salesman was good.</span>",3.0,a week ago

However the communication between him and the finance ans the team wasn't good. Trade equity check took twice as long to get then what was promised (was told 3 to 5 days, got it on the 11th day after the sale and I had to go to the dealer twice to make it happen since nobody answers the phones and they give you the transfer in circle game).

Vince Rossi,"<span class=""review-full-text"" style=""display:none"">Salesman was helpful. Didn't get me the deal I initially wanted to do but his alternative suggestion worked well. However the communication between him and the finance ans the team wasn't good. Trade equity check took twice as long to get then what was promised (was told 3 to 5 days, got it on the 11th day after the sale and I had to go to the dealer twice to make it happen since nobody answers the phones and they give you the transfer in circle game).

Vince Rossi,"<span class=""review-full-text"" style=""display:none"">Salesman was helpful. Didn't get me the deal I initially wanted to do but his alternative suggestion worked well. However the communication between him and the finance ans the team wasn't good. Trade equity check took twice as long to get then what was promised (was told 3 to 5 days, got it on the 11th day after the sale and I had to go to the dealer twice to make it happen since nobody answers the phones and they give you the transfer in circle game). Probably wouldn't shop here again but again the Salesman was good.</span>",3.0,a week ago
